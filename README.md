## Overview

This project focuses on developing a neural network for detecting signs using computer vision techniques. The goal is to recognize and classify various signs captured through image or video input.

## Features

- **Hand Sign Recognition:** The neural network is designed to recognize and classify hand signs in real-time.
  
- **Multiple Gestures:** Supports the detection of a variety of hand gestures, providing a versatile solution for sign language or gesture-based communication.

- **MediaPipe and OpenCV:** Utilizes the MediaPipe library for hand tracking and OpenCV for image and video processing.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- MediaPipe
- TensorFlow (or other deep learning framework)
- [Other dependencies...]

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   https://github.com/Sajithrajan03/Sign_Detection_NNDL.git
   cd .\hand-gesture-recognition-mediapipe\
